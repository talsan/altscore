  "advantages": "It's well established that hiring behaviors can correlate to future financial performance in labor-intensive industries. But, our clients also know that in order to extract sufficient insights that can yield alpha, you need to be able to look more deeply than just hiring volumes. That is why we include metrics on pay levels, labor availability, role mapping, skills requirements, and many other factors with every job we track. And, we provide the most complete real-time view of the entire labor market - not just the hiring needs of publicly-traded companies. We don\u2019t outsource our data collection, nor do we limit our operations to data exhaust from some other business. We built our data platform to meet the needs of the most savvy analysts, which is why we combine large scale real-time tracking with complete transparency and AI-fueled normalization. And, we make our data platform simple to access and simple to use. No one else offers this complete package.",
